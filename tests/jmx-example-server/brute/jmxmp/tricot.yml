tests:
  - title: Bruteforce Unauth JMXMP
    description: |-
      Performs a bruteforce attack on a JMXMP endpoint that
      does not require authentication. It is expected that
      beanshooter detects that no credentials are required.

    command:
      - beanshooter
      - brute
      - ${JMXMP_UNAUTH}
      - ${OPTIONS}

    validators:
      - error: False
      - contains:
          values:
            - The targeted JMX service accepts unauthenticated connections.
            - No need to bruteforce credentials.

  - title: Bruteforce Unauth JMXMP (TLS)
    description: |-
      Performs a bruteforce attack on a JMXMP endpoint that
      does not require authentication. It is expected that
      beanshooter detects that no credentials are required.

    command:
      - beanshooter
      - brute
      - ${JMXMP_TLS}
      - ${OPTIONS}

    validators:
      - error: False
      - contains:
          values:
            - The targeted JMX service accepts unauthenticated connections.
            - No need to bruteforce credentials.

  - title: Bruteforce Plain JMXMP
    description: |-
      Peforms a bruteforce attack on a JMXMP with TLS PLAIN SASL
      profile configured. Valid credentials are monitorRole:monitor
      and controlRole:control and beanshooter is expected to find both
      of them.

    command:
      - beanshooter
      - brute
      - ${JMXMP_PLAIN}
      - ${OPTIONS}

    validators:
      - error: False
      - contains:
          values:
            - 'Found valid credentials: monitorRole:monitor'
            - 'Found valid credentials: controlRole:control'

  - title: Bruteforce Digest JMXMP
    description: |-
      Peforms a bruteforce attack on a JMXMP with TLS Digest SASL
      profile configured. This is expected to lead to an exception,
      because the Digest SASL profile requires an exact hostname
      to work.

    command:
      - beanshooter
      - brute
      - ${JMXMP_DIGEST}
      - ${OPTIONS}

    validators:
      - error: True
      - contains:
          values:
            - 'Digest authentication requires the correct hostname to be used.'

  - title: Bruteforce CRAM JMXMP
    description: |-
      Peforms a bruteforce attack on a JMXMP with TLS CRAM SASL
      profile configured. Valid credentials are monitorRole:monitor
      and controlRole:control and beanshooter is expected to find both
      of them.

    command:
      - beanshooter
      - brute
      - ${JMXMP_CRAM}
      - ${OPTIONS}

    validators:
      - error: False
      - contains:
          values:
            - 'Found valid credentials: monitorRole:monitor'
            - 'Found valid credentials: controlRole:control'

  - title: Bruteforce NTLM JMXMP
    description: |-
      Peforms a bruteforce attack on a JMXMP with TLS NTLM SASL
      profile configured. Valid credentials are monitorRole:monitor
      and controlRole:control and beanshooter is expected to find both
      of them.

    command:
      - beanshooter
      - brute
      - ${JMXMP_NTLM}
      - ${OPTIONS}

    validators:
