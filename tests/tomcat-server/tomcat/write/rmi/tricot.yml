    description: |-
      Use the write action to write user controlled content into the docker volume.
      Unfortunately, it is currently not possible to check the content of the written
      file when not running tricot as root. This is because the tomcat service in the
      currently used container runs as root and writes the file as read protected from
      other users.

    command:
      - beanshooter
      - tomcat
      - write
      - ${TARGET}
      - ${OPTIONS}
      - ${tempfile}
      - ${volume-d}/test.jsp

    validators:
      - error: False
      - contains:
          values:
            - 'Writing local file ${tempfile} to server location ${volume-d}/test.jsp'
            - 'conf/tomcat-users.xml'
            - 'All done.'
