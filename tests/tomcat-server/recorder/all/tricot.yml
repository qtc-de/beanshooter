  title: recorder actions
  description: |-
    The actions of beanshooters recorder operation all kind of depend
    on each other. Performing the tests separately would not make much
    sense, as a test for one action would require to also invoke the
    other one. Therefore, we use one test module to test all actions
    at once.
