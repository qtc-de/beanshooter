### Plugins

----

This folder contains some resources related to *beanshooter* plugins. Several operations of *beanshooter*
can be customized using plugins. Building them is not that straight forward and the documentation is still
work in progress. This folder contains some example plugins as well as a build script to demonstrate the
general plugin structure. The build script will not work for more complex plugins.
